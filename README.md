## Code
### A how-to-run demo
You may run the script [ run_demo.m ] inside the [
Code ] folder.

### Running experiments
Before starting, there are some issues you need to
watch out for:

1. Prior to running any experiment, you must
have run [ Code/setup.m ], which adds relevant
paths and compile required mex files.
2. All commands must run in the [ Code ]
directory.
